                In this page you will find some conceps, strategies and details about the dota's gameplay.
                Dota 2 is a MOBA game style, thatâ€™s mean there are 5 five players in each team trying to destroy the enemy main structure, the Ancient. 
                Although many MOBA games are very similar, Dota 2 has its peculiarities that make it more interesting and challenging than the others. 
                As mentioned above, you will play in a team. To do this you will have to be very patient, strategic and communicative. 
                Communication is essential, especially for those who are going to play with unknown people. 
                Because of this, it is recommended that the player is at least 12 years old when starting to play. 
                The game has its own voice communication and chat system. You could configure that in the environments.

            <p>
                In many MOBA-type games, what defines the winning team is the execution ability of the hero that each player selected. 
                In Dota this is a little different. 
                Because what matters most is mastering the map and executing the objectives and strategies that must be taken during the game. 
                Some strategies that you should learn and master when playing MOBA are: dive, split push and team fight. 
                Here you will find some conceps about they, but I recommend that you study each of these more depth.
