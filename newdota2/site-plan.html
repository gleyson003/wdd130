      <p>
        Dota 2 news is an information website about the game Defense of the Ancients (Dota 2). 
        Here you will understand how to start in the game. 
        You also will know more about championships, international events, news, curiosities and more. 
        Then, on this website you could get knowledge about all you need doing and knowing to be prepared to start you journey in Dota 2. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The word DOTA is an acronym of the game’s name. 
        During the development of the second version of the game, it was decided by the gaming community that the game should be called Dota, 
        as no one was using the game's full name. 
        So, the number 2 was also added to refer to the new version. 
        Thus, the name Dota 2 became official. 
      </p>
      <P>A curiosity of the game that it is free. 
        You don’t need paying to play. All heroes are free. 
        If you wish you can buy some skins and accessories for your hero, but it is just visual, it will not give you any advantage in the game. 
        You can also buy the battle pass. With it you will unlock some features, exclusive skins and extra missions. 
        In addition to increasing the XP and coins you earn on the game platform. 
        This won't influence matches, but it can help you develop quickly as a player due to the new features that give you visibility about your performance.
      </P>
      <P>
        Furthermore, Dota 2 is a desktop game. 
        So, you will need have a good computer to play. 
        You can find the minimum specs for your computer to run the game by clicking the button. 
        When the page loads, scroll down until you find the system requirements.

      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>
        In this page you will find some conceps, strategies and details about the dota's gameplay.
        Dota 2 is a MOBA game style, that’s mean there are 5 five players in each team trying to destroy the enemy main structure, the Ancient. 
        Although many MOBA games are very similar, Dota 2 has its peculiarities that make it more interesting and challenging than the others. 
        As mentioned above, you will play in a team. To do this you will have to be very patient, strategic and communicative. 
        Communication is essential, especially for those who are going to play with unknown people. 
        Because of this, it is recommended that the player is at least 12 years old when starting to play. 
        The game has its own voice communication and chat system. You could configure that in the environments. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In many MOBA-type games, what defines the winning team is the execution ability of the hero that each player selected. 
        In Dota this is a little different. 
        Because what matters most is mastering the map and executing the objectives and strategies that must be taken during the game. 
        Some strategies that you should learn and master when playing MOBA are: dive, split push and team fight. 
        Here you will find some conceps about they, but I recommend that you study each of these more depth.
      </p>
      <p>  
        Furthermore, there are other details that make DOTA 2 so different from other mobas. 
        Each of them is extremely important and you will need to master them. 
        I will list these elements here: Trees, holes, walls, teleport points, vision bridges, sentry points, highgrounds,
        day shift, night shift, last hit, dined and bodyblock.

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        The most relevant event in DOTA 2 is called The Internacional (TI). 
        This event happens once a year. It is transmitted on Steam TV, Twitch and within the platform game. 
        Furthermore, teams from the main regions of the world are selected. 
        The winning team receives a prize and is recognized as the best team of the year. Only the best players are selected, and you can be one of them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For you to get there, you need to rank well in matches and join a team. 
        Here you will find importants suggestions about how you can be a better player.
        Each button below has specific content to let you know the path you should take to become a professional.
