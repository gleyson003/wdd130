                The word DOTA is an acronym of the game’s name.
                During the development of the second version of the game, it was decided by the gaming community that the
                game should be called Dota,
                as no one was using the game's full name.
                So, the number 2 was also added to refer to the new version.
                Thus, the name Dota 2 became official.
